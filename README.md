# 📊 Employee Management System (Python + JSON + SQLite)

This project is a simple employee management system developed in **Python**, using a **JSON file** as the data source and **SQLite** as the database.  
It simulates a real-world business scenario where employee information must be validated, stored, and queried efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Read employee data from a JSON file
- Validate required employee fields
- Detect empty or invalid values
- Prevent duplicate employee records
- Store data in a SQLite database
- Query active and inactive employees
- Generate a final processing report

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- SQLite
- JSON
- Standard Python Libraries (`json`, `sqlite3`, `os`)

## 📄 JSON File Format

The application expects a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "Employee_id": 1001,
    "Name": "John Doe",
    "Department": "Software",
    "Role": "Backend Developer",
    "Status": "ACTIVO",
    "Salary": 4000
  }
]

▶️ How to Run

python main.py

📊 Sample Output
Active employees loaded successfully.
Total employees processed: 5
Active employees found: 3
